Sunlight fills your eyes as you awaken lying prone on the pavement of a supermarket parking lot. As you try to stand up, you notice that your arms have been replaced with two stumps capped with coagulated blood. After a few minutes of wiggling around, you’re able to maneuver into a sitting position and begin taking in your surroundings.
Your eyes land on the supermarket and find that it’s been blown to smithereens. In fact, you find that everything around you has been blown to smithereens. The scene is shocking, but not surprising. Nuclear war has been inevitable for some time now. You stand up and begin exploring.
After a few minutes of examining the devastated buildings, you hear a shriek in the distance. Excited, you run towards it. A few minutes later, you arrive in the local park. The plants have an unhealthy yellow tinge to them, and the grass is overgrown.
In the distance you see something in the grass. When you reach it, you realize that it’s a dead body. It smells terrible and its midsection has a large chunk of flesh missing.
You start to walk away from the body when another shriek rings out. You look back and immediately wish you hadn’t. Before you stands a horrible monster. A beast of conceivably Lovecraftian conception. Its head, similar to that of a pig and supported by a disproportionately long neck, shrieks madly at you. Its two, thin, tentacle-like limbs flail wildly.
You notice that it’s struggling to support itself on such thin limbs. You also notice that it’s about to kill you. Without another moment’s hesitation, you turn around and start running.
You sprint out of the park, hopping over the corpse on the way. You’re almost back to the parking lot when you trip on your untied shoelaces. You hit the ground hard and struggle desperately to get up. The beast saunters toward you. It’s only meters away when you notice a stick on the ground beside you.

You lose your will to live as the shadow of the beast blankets you. You use the last of your strength to roll over onto your back. Without hesitation, the monster plunges one of its limbs into your eye. The shock alone would kill anyone else, but your abdication of life keeps you calm and extends your pain for another few seconds. You remain silent as its jagged teeth sink into your abdomen, as it slowly separates your lower leg from your knee, and as it rips your other leg right out of its socket. You remain silent up to the moment that death drags you through its doors into serene oblivion.

Fluorescent light fills your eyes as you awaken in a bright cave filled with glowing pink crystals. You look down and notice that you’re floating. Your limbs and eyeball have also returned. You look up and notice that you’re not the only one here. A group of people are gathered outside. You float out of the cave and find yourself in an even bigger cave with hundreds of people in it. There are houses and skyscrapers all made of the pink crystals. There seems to be an entire civilization here.
“HEY YOU! WHAT IS THIS PLACE?” You yell at an old woman as you float towards her. She turns around and looks at you inquisitively.
“Are you new here young man?” She asks.
“Where’s here?”
She pauses for a moment. “The afterlife. Some older folk like to call it Elysium. Everyone got taken here after the nuclear apocalypse.”
Your mind starts racing. “Nuclear apocalypse?” You ask.
“Yes dear… nuclear apocalypse. Last month the president shot off the entire nuclear arsenal! We still had a few people trickle in from radiation poisoning last week, but you’re probably the last of ‘em.”
“Is there any way out of here?”
“Funny you should ask.” She pauses again. “Only three people have ever escaped Elysium. It happened just last week. Nobody knows how.”
“Okay, thanks lady.” You float away thinking that you might be trapped here forever.

It’s felt like years since you died. As you wake up to the sight of crystals stretching monotonously into eternity, you decide you can’t take it anymore. You want to eat something. You want to drink something. You want to get out of here.
You go to a cave rumoured to have been used by the three people that escaped. It’s already been examined rigorously, but you are confident that you’ll spot something new. You scan the area for seven hours, but by the end you notice nothing.
“THERE’S GOTTA BE SOMETHING HERE!” You yell and punch a wall. The wall shatters revealing a small room with a leather notebook inside. You float in and open it. According to the first page, it belonged to an occultist obsessed with escaping named Kallikrates. His experiments included kicking something so hard you rip a hole through spacetime and snorting the pink crystals. Kallikrates had labeled all of them as failures except for the one on the last page.
“Does that mean it worked?” You read the page, becoming increasingly horrified with each word. Kallikrates’ last attempt involved killing people, taking their hearts, mixing them with the pink crystals, and then snorting them.
Feeling nauseous, you look up from the book and notice two corpses on the far side of the room. The truth dawns on you: only one person escaped Elysium that day, and he killed the other two to do it.
A few minutes later, you make your decision. Kallikrates used one heart; there’s one left.
“It isn’t wrong. They’re already dead.” Closing your eyes, you reach into the corpse and pull out its heart. Then you kick down a crystal and stomp it to powder. You place the heart on the powder and the heart disintegrates, turning the powder crimson. You drop to your knees and inhale.
Sunlight fills your eyes as you awaken. You’re alive! As you caress the grass and hug the trees, you are unable to recall a happier time.
“Freedom! Free-” You hear a shriek right behind you.

It’s been years since you died but it isn’t as bad as you first thought. As you wake up to the sight of crystals stretching monotonously into eternity, you hear a commotion. You float over to see a group gathered around an old man waving his arms wildly and screaming something about a “soft room”.
You turn to someone next to you. “What’s going on?”
 “The president just died.” They point to the old man. “The one that nuked everyone.”
“We should beat him up!” Yells someone in the crowd.
“Kill him!” Yells another.
“No!” The old man screams. “Please no!”
A woman steps into the middle of the circle. “We should have a trial! With a jury and stuff!” You hear some murmurs of agreement. “Okay then! Let’s find some judges. Someone should also look after the priso-”
“MURDER!” A shout from nearby. Suddenly, a group of people with terrified looks on their faces rush into the cave and towards the exit. They are followed by another group carrying crystals. This group is led by a man with raven black hair holding a brown notebook.
“HEARTS! HEARTS ARE THE KEY!” The man shouts and charges at the group surrounding the old man. Hundreds of screams echo through the cave as everyone rushes for the exit. The old man is too slow and is grabbed by the leader. You watch as the former president’s eyes are gouged out, his chest is cut open, and his heart is removed. The leader shoves the heart and the crystal to his face and the next moment, he vanishes.
Something wraps around your foot. You look down in time to see a young woman stab you in the thigh.
“AAAAH!!!” You wriggle and squirm but can’t get free of her grip. She raises her crystal again and brings it down across your chest. Blood flies everywhere. You feel a hand reach inside you. A moment later, you feel terrible pain and you look down to see the grinning woman with your heart in her hand. Things start to become fuzzy, and you feel cold…  very cold. The world fades to black and you die.

Using the little strength you have left, you crawl desperately towards the stick. Upon reaching it, you realise you’re an idiot. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PICK UP A STICK WITHOUT ANY ARMS? The monster saunters closer. You clasp the stick between your feet and wave it wildy.
“BACK OFF! I’M WARNING YOU!” The monster doesn’t seem to understand. As a desperate last resource, you raise your feet in the air and bring them down hard while letting go of the stick. The stick flies through the air, spins three times, and hits the monster directly in the eye. The beast stumbles, its limbs give in and it collapses unconscious.
“HA! GET BENT LOSER!” You shout before passing out from exhaustion.

An hour later, you wake up and crawl over to the unconscious monster. Your stomach rumbles, introducing you to a new problem: there’s no food anywhere. After some consideration, you realise your best chance at survival is to eat the pig. You retake the stick between your feet and pierce the pig’s neck. A translucent, crimson liquid flows out. The beast releases one last ear-splitting shriek and then dies.
Using your feet, you rip out a loose chunk of flesh. It's raw and the smell is repugnant, but you have to eat it. You force yourself to take a small bite.
 The moment it touches your taste buds, you’re sent into a state of shock. At first, the taste confuses you. But after it goes down your throat, you realise what it is: it’s the greatest thing you’ve ever tasted, the best thing you’ve ever felt, pure elation.
You kneel down and start gnawing into the pig’s body, somehow giggling and screaming at the same time. Blood covers your face but you don’t care. Bones dig into your skin but you don’t care. Right now, there is only one thing you care about: eating the pig.
Ten minutes later, the delirium starts to fade. As you stare at the pile of bones that was once a monster, a thought bounces around in your head: “I gotta find another one of those!”

You head back to the park to try and find another pig. A few minutes later, you’re back beside the corpse. You sit down and listen for footsteps.
Later, just as you’re about to give up, you hear rustling from behind a bush. You sneak behind a tree just as a figure emerges. You bite down on your tongue to stop yourself from screaming.
Your eyes say the figure is human, but your other senses scream that it can’t be. It can’t be human because you can hear the groaning of its bones as it moves and the damp emptiness of its lungs as it breathes. It can’t be human because you can smell its corrosion and decay, the smell of a thousand rotting corpses.
The figure is wearing a red robe and holding a bloodied scythe. But its head… It has the head of a pig. A pig with red eyes and twisted antlers. You’re reminded of the Wendigo, the antlered cannibal from indigenous myth.
The Wendigo walks to the corpse and brings down its scythe twice, severing the corpse’s arms. The Wendigo kneels and whispers into the corpse’s ear.
The corpse begins to convulse. Its eyes burst open and roll back. The Wendigo picks up a severed arm and starts eating it. With each bite, the convulsing body expands, its neck elongates, its legs lengthen, and by the time the arm is picked clean, the corpse has become a pig.
Several realisations dawn on you. You must have been resurrected by a failed attempt to turn you into a pig. The same type of pig that you just ate. You try to remain calm, but the idea that you ate a human is too much to handle. You begin vomiting. The Wendigo turns towards you. Through the corner of your eyes, you see a scythe come down on your head.

Sunlight fills your eyes as you awaken lying in a park. Trees are a lot smaller than you remember, and everything is tinted pink. Why are you still alive? You look down and discover why. You have tentacles instead of legs. You have a snout instead of a nose. You’re ten feet tall. You’ve become a pig.

You head into a forest to try and find another pig. A few minutes later, one emerges from behind a tree. At the sight of the magnificent creature, you lose all self consciousness and rush towards it on all fours.
You crash into the monster’s midsection, forcing it off balance and sending it crashing to the ground. You bite into its savory flesh as it writhes and shrieks in protest. The feeling is almost as good as the first time and just moments later, the pig is picked clean. Most of its flesh was eaten when it was still alive. You feel disgusted with yourself, but you still want more.
The next day, you travel deeper into the forest and kill another pig. The rush is lower this time, emboldening you to kill another.
With each pig you eat, you become more and more bloodthirsty. The strange pig meat seems to be promoting cellular growth. You can feel your arms growing back and something is burgeoning out of your head.

Months later, you’ve made your way to the Southern United States, and you’ve lost count of how many pigs you’ve eaten along the way. As you walk into an abandoned museum in search of more pigs, a display catches your eye. Encased in glass is a man with the face of a pig and antlers growing out of his head like a Wendigo. His arms are short and stubby, and his skin is bright pink. You wonder whether he would taste similar to the monsters.
As you reach out to touch the glass, you are shocked to see the Wendigo mirroring your exact movements. You jump a little and the Wendigo jumps too. Looking down at yourself, you realise what’s going on: It’s a mirror. You are the Wendigo.
You begin laughing hysterically. Looking down at your smooth pink skin you just can’t resist. Through bouts of frenzied laughter, you bite off your fingers and arms. You gnaw at your toes and your legs. You laugh, shriek and howl until your last ounce of blood drips out onto the cold, hard floor.

While fiddling with a swiss army knife in a supermarket parking lot, you are approached by a middle-aged man wearing shiny leather shoes.
“Hey kid! You want some meth?” The man flashes a Ziploc bag filled with experimental methamphetamine. You think for a moment, then decide to do what any reasonable person would do in this situation and threaten the man with your swiss army knife.
You leave the encounter with $600, a Ziploc bag filled with experimental methamphetamine, and a flashy new pair of leather shoes. Unable to help yourself, you immediately start crushing up the meth with the bottom of your swiss army knife, and it’s not long before all of it disappears through your nose and into your bloodstream.
BOOM!
An explosion rings out far in the distance. A mushroom cloud forms on the horizon. “What th-”
BOOOM!!
Another explosion, this time much closer.
BOOOOM!!! A missile lands right next to you. Everything around you is swept away in a flash of fire and fury. 
For a moment, there is nothing but darkness, then something incredible starts to happen. The experimental chemicals in your body absorb the blast and start to change you. All at once, you see vision from four alternate realities in which the bomb kills you. From these visions, you learn that the president of the United States just started the nuclear apocalypse, and that next month the Wendigo Kallikrates will escape the afterlife and use corpses to create an army of undead pig monsters.
When your mind returns to the present, you find that there’s a strange tingling sensation throughout your entire body. Your neck begins to shorten as your head retreats into your shoulders. Your skin turns green and scaly. Your arms become short and stubby, and your legs grow long and muscular. The experimental methamphetamine has mixed with the nuclear radiation to evolve you into a Turtle-Kangaroo Hybrid!

A month later, you’re sitting atop a tree in Eretria, Greece awaiting the arrival of the Wendigo Kallikrates. With the power of both the turtle *and* the kangaroo, he stands no chance. At six in the evening, just as the sun touches the horizon, Kallikrates and his legion of pig monsters emerge from behind a hill. You leap off the tree and land at the foot of the hill. 
“Who are you?” Kallikrates asks in Greek.
“Dude I have no idea what you just said.” You draw your two machine pistols and open fire on Kallikrates. The Wendigo moves with unexpected speed to take cover behind his monsters. A storm of crimson flies through the air as pig monsters drop to the ground in the hundreds. Standing behind his army, Kallikrates casts a spell and sends fireballs hurling toward you. You dodge them easily and continue firing.
Seeing their dwindling numbers, you tuck your head into your shell and throw yourself at the monsters shielding Kallikrates. You hit their legs and knock them all down, exposing the Wendigo.
You bring your right leg back, and then using the full power of both the turtle *and* the kangaroo, you unleash a kick so strong that the Wendigo instantly implodes in a flash of blue light. A moment later, it’s replaced with a swirling blue portal. Your kick was so powerful that it ripped a hole through spacetime! You think for a moment, then decide to do what any reasonable person would do in this situation and jump in the portal.

Sunlight fills your eyes as you awaken lying prone on the pavement of a Foody Mart parking lot. You stand up and see a man without any pants crawl out of a ventilation shaft with a cart full of cookies. After a moment, you recognise him as the would-be president. Without a moment's hesitation, you shoot him in the head.
With the Foody Mart Robbery stopped, the president who ends the world is never elected and never gets access to nuclear weapons. You stopped the apocalypse and saved the world!
The End.
