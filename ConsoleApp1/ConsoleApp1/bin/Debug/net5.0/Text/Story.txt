**Part One: Jack Platt
Chapter One: Jack Is Alive**
The 21st century was a chaotic time filled with all sorts of terrible tragedies. Very few could ever forget the Reese’s Pieces factory explosion of 2041 or the Angry Birds riot of 2043. However, many could and already have forgotten an incident equally as important but not as well known: The Humpty Dumpty Incident of 2025.
Today, on the centennial of this horrible event, I invite you all to join me as I take a look back at this tragedy and the bizarre story that led to it.
As this story pertains to the life of Frank Wellington, I highly recommend you read his first autobiography (*Run Like a Turtle, Jump Like a Kangaroo* (bizarrely told in second person present tense)) before continuing on.
With that out of the way, I would like to start this story where Frank’s left off: with the presumed death of presidential candidate Jack Platt. The following excerpt is from an article published by the Toronto Triceratops on the day after Jack Platt was found in the infamous Foody Mart parking lot.
- Dr Richard J. Nguyen, Historian, January 1 2125

May 14, 2024: Early Monday morning, fringe presidential candidate Jack Platt was found in a Foody Mart parking lot with a bullet lodged in his skull. Several witnesses claimed he had no pants on, but no confirmation of this has been released.
Platt was rushed to the hospital where emergency brain surgery was performed. At two in the afternoon, it was announced that he was in stable condition. … 
Later in the evening, the surgeon that operated on Platt commented that his survival was “not surprising” since “his skull was remarkably thick.” Even going as far as to say that “it was the thickest skull [he] had ever seen. I mean it wasn’t even close! That thing took like an hour to drill through!” 
The doctor later clarified that his previous comments were “not meant to be an insult, even if it could be perceived that way” and commented that he is “very sorry for any offence he may have caused” among Platt’s small but dedicated group of supporters.

Chapter Two: Jack Is Immediately Apprehended by the Authorities**
Six days later, Jack Platt was arrested. Many historians have theorised that Frank Wellington—an avid reader of the Toronto Triceratops as mentioned in his second autobiography (*Jump Like a Turtle, Run Like a Kangaroo* (bizarrely told in third person future tense))—was the one that tipped off the police. I will let you decide for yourself whether or not this theory holds any merit.

May 21, 2024: Independant presidential candidate Jack Platt, known online as “the guy that’s running for president and that got shot in a Foody Mart parking lot but was too stupid to die”, was arrested last night in his hospital room after dangerous chemicals and troubling manifestos were found in his Ontario residence …
The police received the tip over the phone from a man identifying himself as “Frank”. Policewoman Jane Boingus later commented that “Frank had the strangest voice [she] had ever heard. I mean it wasn’t even close! He had this subtle Oceanic accent like maybe he grew up there and moved to Canada as a teenager or something, but that’s not what was weird! He sounded like what would happen if a turtle could talk—or maybe like a kangaroo—or maybe a little bit of both!”
An hour after making those comments Jane Boingus was admitted to Mackenzie Bowell Psychiatric Hospital on the behest of her mother …

Chapter Three*: Jack Is Sent to Mackenzie Bowell Psychiatric Hospital*
The trial of Jack Platt was extensively covered in the media for the next several months. Almost everyday, new information about Platt’s life, family history and illegal conduct was being uncovered and discussed. The trial finally ended on June 25, 2024 and the verdict was immediately reported in the Toronto Triceratops.

June 25, 2024: The trial of former fringe presidential candidate Jack Platt, also commonly known online as “the guy that was running for president and that got shot in a Foody Mart parking lot but was too stupid to die and that bought a bunch of illegal chemicals” concluded this evening. The public was shocked to learn that Platt had been found not guilty on all charges following a successful insanity defence. … 
The prosecutor later commented that it was “disappointing but not unexpected. I mean, really, [Platt] was completely insane in there! Craziest guy I’ve ever seen! I mean it wasn’t even close! Rambling about mind control and aliens and turtle kangaroo hybrids! … 
Platt is to undergo psychiatric evaluation and treatment at Mackenzie Bowell Psychiatric Hospital, where incidentally, popular singer-songwriter Ben Lecount is also being treated.

Chapter One: Louisa Sends a Nice Letter**
There are some stories that make me very sad. When telling these stories, I become convinced that there is no order in the universe. That we are all just birds flying toward kitchen windows or mad scientists falling off seven story buildings just to be hit by angry drivers in 2002 Ford Mustangs.
Fortunately, this is not one of those stories, at least not yet. In fact, I am pleased to be able to tell you that this story is filled to the brim with comical coincidences and improbable antics that are sure to make you think “Wow! What a comical coincidence!” or maybe even “Wow! What an improbable antic!”. 
Below is anecdotal proof of one such comical coincidence/improbable antic in the form of a letter written by an “independent biomechanical researcher” to her mother and her little brother.
- Dr Richard J. Nguyen, Historian, January 9 2125

May 14, 2024
“Dear Mom, I saw something unbelievable yesterday! I had just gotten off the bus and I was walking to my office when I saw this unconscious man bleeding out in a parking lot and I was like “Oh okay that’s nice” but then farther away I caught a glimpse of something big and hairy. It could have been a kangaroo except for the big shell on its back and the green skin underneath all that fur.
I stood there frozen for a moment until the full gravity of the situation hit me. My legs started to feel weak and moments later they gave out and I collapsed on the sidewalk. I felt a feeling of wonder greater than I have ever felt. I layed there stunned for what seemed like an eternity. This creature that I had glimpsed was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
As I layed there on the sidewalk oblivious to the stares that I must have been receiving, I contemplated its magnificence. Its legs were so strong and stable yet so agile and light. The shell on its back was so mighty and immovable yet so ornate and fragile. I marvelled at its ingenuity, its power, its DYNAMISM. 
Then a simple thought slipped into my head. At first it felt blasphemous but as I slowly succumbed to its allure that feeling slipped away and I was left with a sense of divine righteousness. “I COULD DO BETTER.” The thought said. I rose to my feet and brushed off the small pebbles and whatnot that had stuck to me. “I COULD DO BETTER.” I whispered to myself… Yeah pretty cool story huh? Hope you’re doing okay!
Love, Dr. Louisa Koné
P.S. Oh, and give this letter to Oumar too. I'm sure he’d enjoy this story.

Chapter Two: Louisa Sends a Bad Letter**
After sending the aforementioned letter to her mother, Dr. Koné did not leave her house for 6 months. When she did finally leave her house on November 16, 2024 it was to send another letter, this time to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police

Dear Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
I am Dr. Louisa Koné, an independent biomechanical researcher that has an idea that I will CHANGE THE WORLD. It all started when I witnessed what I believe to be the Kangaroo-Turtle hybrid that has been speculated about in the news recently. With the brief moment that I was able to examine it, I identified all its strengths and weaknesses. And with that knowledge, I believe I can create something superior.
Most of the Kangaroo-Turtle’s strength comes from the raw power of the kangaroo. The strong legs of the kangaroo allow it to jump high but its running speed is outclassed by other creatures. It is my hypothesis that the turtle is only there to stabilize the chaotic potential of the kangaroo, because the turtle on its own can neither jump high nor run fast. I believe that by using the exact opposite of the kangaroo and the turtle we can not only create a more powerful creature, but one equally as stable without sacrificing performance by using a suboptimal element such as the turtle.
Instead of selecting a chaotic element and a stable one, the much better approach would be to select 2 elements so chaotic that their chaos would overflow the natural alignment of the universe thus overflowing the universal bar of discordance and create an entity so unstable that it becomes stable again.
After several months of research, I have identified the exact opposite of both the turtle and the kangaroo. The turtle can neither jump high nor run fast. Therefore the opposite of such an element would be a creature that can jump very high and run very fast. From that criteria I have identified the perfect element to be THE CHEETAH. The kangaroo can jump high but cannot run very fast. Therefore the opposite of such an element would be a creature that cannot jump but can go very fast. From that criteria I have identified the perfect element to be THE MONORAIL. These two elements combined would easily overflow the universal bar of discordance and create the perfect creature: THE CHEETAH MONORAIL HYBRID.

Dear Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
I believe there has been some sort of mistake as I have not yet received my 117 million dollars. After careful consideration, I have decided to raise the price to 141 million dollars.
I sympathise with the fact that it might be difficult to convince your superiors why you would need such an amount of money, but if I don’t receive my money within the next 3 business days I will be forced to raise the amount to 161 million dollars.
To help you convince your superiors, I have attached this song that I have spent the last 72 hours writing nonstop. It is called “Cheetah Monorail Hybrid” and the score is attached on the next page. If you do indeed decide to perform it for your superiors, I expect no expense to be spared. 
I have also attached an infographic that might appeal better to your superiors’ level of intellect. Again, please send 141 million dollars to 26 Cottonwood Ct, Thornhill, ON L3T 5X1 so I can begin construction.
Sincerely, Dr. Louisa Koné

Over the next month and a half, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and various other institutions received over two hundred letters from Dr. Koné, none of which I have included here for the sake of your sanity. (You're welcome.) 
After receiving no responses, Dr. Koné came to the conclusion that so many before her have come to: “Existing sucks so I should turn to a life of supervillainy.” And so on September 21 2025, Dr. Louisa Koné, who was by all witness accounts a kind and thoughtful (if not a bit weird) lady, robbed a bank with giant murder robots.

**Part Three: Frank Wellington
Chapter One: Frank Reads the Local Paper**
As the popular folk song would have it, after saving the world on May 13 2024, Frank Wellington retired to the Canadian Wilderness for 225 days. This number may seem completely arbitrary to you, but this number is the only reason that I, along with so many others, continue to exist on this planet. (Comical coincidence! Improbable antic!)
On the 226th day after the averted apocalypse, Frank ended his retirement and checked the internet to find something useful to do. The news article that he happened to stumble upon and that I have included below was published by the Toronto Triceratops and was concerning the most recent in a string of bank robberies.
- Dr Richard J. Nguyen, Historian, January 18 2125

December 24, 2024: Police are puzzled after another bank robbery in the series of robberies dubbed the “series of giant murder robot robberies of 2025”. Yesterday at 11:52 pm, the robots were spotted in a strip mall parking lot by two civilians who then approached the robots, mistakenly believing one of them to be “Daytrader” from the 2017 Michael Bay movie “Transformers: The Last Knight”. Tests later revealed the civilians to be heavily inebriated. The robots, 8–10 feet tall with various miscellaneous sharp objects duct taped to their appendages, severed several of the teenage boys’ limbs and entered the Toronto-Dominion Bank by fracturing the glass walls.
The robots stole an estimated $68 million dollars which puts the total estimated value of all the robberies at $171 million dollars. Before local law enforcement could arrive, security footage shows the robots escaping through some form of aeronautical propulsion…
UPDATE: Early this morning police released security footage found near the scene of the crime. The footage shows a young woman with dark skin, tiny circular glasses, and curly hair tinkering with the robots shortly before the robbery began. [Included here is a frame from the aforementioned footage] The woman has been identified as Louisa Koné. Any information about the suspect or her whereabouts should be reported to chief of police Bonnie Boingus via email at officeofthechief@torontopolice.on.ca.

**Part Three: Frank Wellington
Chapter Two: Frank Stalks Someone**
In his fifth autobiography, (*Work Like a Turtle, Play Like a Kangaroo* (bizarrely written in first person future tense)) Frank Wellington describes his various superhuman abilities which include super strength, super healing, super jumping, super running, super smelling, super hearing, and super seeing and super memorizing. In the seventeenth chapter, he claims that he remembers every face that he sees, down to every little detail. This is a likely explanation for how he was able to identify the lady from the news article as the same lady he saw lying on the sidewalk 226 days ago.
Frank goes into detail about what happens next in the second chapter of his third autobiography, (*Live Like a Turtle, Live Like a Kangaroo* (bizarrely written in third person present tense)) relevant portions of which make up the next few chapters.
- Dr Richard J. Nguyen, Historian, January 19 2125

Frank was intrigued by this unlikely coincidence, that the first news article he would read after his vacation would be about the woman he saw lying on the sidewalk that one time, and decided to investigate further. Moreover, Frank thought Louisa Koné’s killer robots were probably too dangerous to leave to local law enforcement. And with that settled, Frank put on his best hat and his best, fluffy, fur coat and he left his cabin for the last time. (As it would later be destroyed by bears)... 
Frank stood in the Foody Mart parking lot, examining the sidewalk that Louisa Koné had collapsed upon from under his broad brimmed hat. Tens of thousands of people must have walked across this sidewalk over the last 226 days, and Frank could smell them all. An old woman with bad breath from 61 days ago, a middle aged man wearing funky cologne from last week, and most importantly, a young woman who had had a ham sandwich with way too many onions for lunch from exactly 226 days ago. It was that scent that Frank was interested in, and that scent that he followed. 
The trail laid out by the scent would have been a lot shorter if not for Frank’s constant detours intended to prevent civilians from getting so close as to notice his green skin and brown fur. After 20 minutes, Frank idententified the building where the scent was strongest: an old seven story office building surrounded by a twenty foot tall fence with legions of do not enter signs posted on every inch of it. “Geez, this lady must be really paranoid.” Frank muttered to himself as he leapt over the fence in a single bound. The only entrance to the building was sealed with 3 combination locks, 2 key locks, 1 fingerprint lock, and 5 card swipes. Frank pulled the door out of its socket, setting off an ear piercing alarm in the process, and tossed it aside as he entered the building
The first floor had a main hallway leading to several rooms, any of which Louisa could have been in, but Frank went right for the elevator. Her scent was strongest on the seventh floor.
It would not be unreasonable for someone stepping into Louisa Koné’s base of operations to believe they had fallen into some sort of interdimensional rift. As for Frank, he was just really confused. The seventh floor was one huge warehouse-like room. It was roughly the length and width of a large airplane hangar and the height of maybe 10 to 15 killer robots stacked ontop of each other. Every surface was painted the brightest shade of magenta and accented with large cyan polka dots at random intervals. At the center of this insane room was a 50 foot long tube of metal. The room was so colourful and outlandish that Frank could do nothing but stare, oblivious to the frying pan coming down on his head.

Chapter Three: Frank Is Offered Some Bacon**
Remember when I told you a chapter ago that the first part of this story has comical coincidences and improbable antics? Well, I’m sad to say that that’s all over now. What comes next is a series of random events, completely void of any direction or significance. 
For readers that are faint of heart, I discourage you from reading any further. Walk away now believing that Frank probably escaped Louisa’s base without too much difficulty, handed her over to the proper authorities and then lived happily ever after. Wouldn’t that be nice?
But for you masochists out there, feel free to keep reading. It’s a free country. 
- Dr Richard J. Nguyen, Historian, January 22 2125

“Hah! I knew it would work!” Frank heard as he woke up. The alarm had stopped but there was a terrible sizzling sound in his ears and his head felt like it was being squeezed like an orange would be squeezed if it was found by a severely dehydrated individual. Frank looked down to find that he was bound to a metal folding chair by several layers of thick rope and some industrial grade duct tape. He looked to his side and was unsurprised to see the woman he had been searching for sitting criss-cross applesauce on the ground. Louisa Koné was wearing a dirty old lab coat and was holding a frying pan above a burning pile of old rags. Frank realised that the sizzling he had in his ears was not sizzling in his head, but was in fact the sizzling of bacon. 
“Would you like some bacon?” Louisa asked politely. 
“No thanks.” Frank replied. “I’m vegetarian.”
Louisa looked offended.“Nonsense!” She got up and plucked three pieces of bacon from the scorching hot frying pan. “Everyone likes bacon!” Louisa waved the bacon in front of Frank.
“Not me,” Said Frank. “Land turtles are herbivores and so are kanga—” Louisa shoved the still sizzling bacon into Frank’s mouth. Frank tried to protest but all that came out were some muffled profanities. He spit the bacon onto the floor beside him. There was a long and awkward pause filled only with the distant humming of machinery. 
“Okay. Whatever. You don’t like bacon. Fine.” Louisa thought for a little while. “You wanna know why this room is so colourful?” Frank did not respond. “So anyone breaking in would be like…” She made a surprised look. “And then I would…” She mimicked hitting someone with a frying pan.
“Uh huh.”
Louisa swapped the frying pan for a fire extinguisher and put out the open flame, then walked to the other side of Frank’s chair. Frank turned to face her and noticed that they were right beside the long tube he had seen earlier. He could now identify it as a sort of train, the biggest train he had ever seen. It was painted orange with black polka dots and the front was shaped like the head of a cheetah, but weirdest of all, it had *legs*. Big. Muscular. Legs. 
“Like her?” Louisa said, proudly pointing to the train. “I call her the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid! It’s the most powerful thing on the planet! So powerful that it could probably be sensed from millions of miles away. Aliens could probably sense it!” Frank looked unimpressed. “Don’t worry, you’re probably still second place.” Louisa reassured him sarcastically.
“Is this what you’ve been doing with your 117 million dollars?” Frank asked.
“Yeah! This and mushrooms!” Louisa laughed and walked over to a small desk. She picked up a large remote with two buttons on it. One orange and one black. She pushed the orange one and loud music began playing from a speaker hidden in the cheetah’s mouth. 
*Cheetah Monorail Hybrid…*
“Like it?” Louisa asked.
*It’s my one ambition…*
“Not particularly.” Frank replied. Frank was being polite. The song was very bad.
*Cheetah Monorail Hybrid…*
“I wrote it myself!” Said Louisa confidently, ignoring Frank’s comment. 
*It’s my only mission…*
bingusShe pressed the orange button again. The music stopped. Her finger moved to the other button.
 “When I press this one, she’ll wake up and fly to me anywhere in the galaxy!”
“What are you going to do with it?” Frank asked.
bingus“I don’t know! I didn’t think I’d get this far!” Louisa replied. “Maybe rob a few more banks, bring a few governments to their knees.” Louisa pocketed the remote, picked up her frying pan again and began to fiddle with it.
“Yeah okay, I think I’ve seen enough here.” Frank burst out of the rope and duct tape with a single flexing motion and snatched the frying pan from Louisa’s hand.
“Wha—” Louisa said. “GIVE IT BACK! NO FAIR!” She reached for her frying pan but Frank easily moved it out of her reach. He tossed the frying pan out the window shattering the thick glass and setting off the alarm again. Louisa shouted something that Frank couldn’t pick up over the blaring of the alarm and began running at him. 
“WAIT NO, STOP! LOOK OUT!” Frank tried to scream over the alarm, but it was too late. Louisa tripped over the pile of old rags. She tumbled to the ground and rolled once… twice… and then out the window. Frank ran up to the window to make sure she was okay. She was not. Louisa Koné was dead.

**Part Four: Colon
Chapter One: Colon Christmas**
At this point in the story it is unfortunately necessary for me to interrupt and give you some exposition. Otherwise, the next part of the story would make no sense.
There is no way to say this casually so I’ll say it as it is: On Christmas Eve of 2024 there was an alien invasion. 
Now you might be thinking: “How come I’ve never heard of this before?” Well there is a simple answer to that question. The general public didn’t know it was an alien invasion until 2042 when Frank Wellingong released his third autobiography, but by then everyone was so focused on the Reese’s Pieces factory explosion that an alien invasion seemed like small beans! Then of course there was the Noodle Man invasion of 2043 which cemented the Colon Christmas of 2024 as a historical footnote.
Below I have included a short excerpt from singer-songwriter Ben Lecount’s second autobiography (*Don't Lecount the Days, Make the Days Lecount* (thankfully written in first person past tense)) to have you put yourself in the shoes of someone who was there during the Colon Christmas.
- Dr Richard J. Nguyen, Historian, January 22 2125

My song “Colon Christmas” was inspired by the Christmas of 2024. Some readers might be old enough to remember it! It was my final day in Quebec city and I was “walking down the street” to Jack’s hotel to say goodbye (he was staying for another month). It was a cold day with a little bit of snow but the sun was super bright. 
I was about halfway to the hotel when the sunlight started to fade. At first it was slow and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but then it sped up and it only took two minutes for the sunlight to be gone almost completely! Everyone was left in what seemed at the time to be total darkness and with this horrible oily smell.
I heard a couple of kids screaming their heads off and I didn’t know what they were so scared of until I looked up and saw it for myself: the Devil’s Coil. The sun was still there but superimposed on it like a bug on a ceiling light was the outline of a human digestive organ.
It scared the hell out of me and I'm not ashamed to admit that I screamed louder than those kids! I’m also not ashamed to admit that I ran the rest of the way to Jack’s hotel, canceled my flight and stayed holed up in there for the next two days.
Jack mysteriously disappeared on Boxing Day morning (which kind of hurt my feelings even though he later said he had had “a family emergency” and his “phone had died”) so I took the time to write a song… 

Okay, I think you get the point. Back to Frank!

Chapter Two: Louisa Fell off a Seven Story Building**
Frank searched for a pulse on Louisa’s wrist. He did not expect to find one. 
She had fallen seven stories onto a busy road. Her head hit the asphalt first with a horrible cracking sound and her body had *bounced* twiced before being hit by a 2002 Ford Mustang. The driver of the Mustang—an Italian man in his late 60s—had rolled down the windows and shouted “HEY! WATCH WHERE YOU’RE GOING! IT’S THE END OF THE WORLD!”. The collision had caused her body to bounce another three times until it came to a stop on the sidewalk where Frank would find it, the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid remote still in her pocket.
Frank started to walk away from Louisa’s body after reaching his conclusion: she was very dead. The deadest Frank had ever seen. [It wasn’t even close!] “Is this really what life is?” Frank thought. “Are we all destined to fall down a seven story building and get hit by an angry Italian man? (Metaphorically of course.)” Frank was very sad. He stopped in the middle of the field and sat down in the grass.
It had been noon when he reached Louisa’s office but the sky was dark now. Frank chalked it up to being unconscious for a couple hours. Well, he *did* until he checked his watch and found out it was 3:23 in the afternoon. Frank scanned the sky for the sun, and when he found it he realized what the angry Italian man had been referring to. The sun was covered by a Giant Colon.
Suddenly, from the “appendix” of the Space Colon, a laser shot out. It wasn’t a wavelength that humans could see, but Frank could make out a small beam of light coming toward him. Frank, still shocked by the giant Space Colon and sad from Louisa's death, continued sitting there on the grass. If he had started running instead, maybe this story would have ended differently. But instead, he sat there like an idiot while a space laser came after him. Two seconds later, the laser entered earth’s atmosphere and hit Frank on the neck.
ZAP!

**Part Four: Colon
Chapter Three: Devil’s Coil**
For the second time in one day, Frank woke up chained to a chair. And for the second time in one day, he broke the chains easily. The room he was in was no larger than a janitor's closet and had an unpleasant oily smell that Frank associated with the kitchen of fast food restaurants. Each wall was painted a different colour: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. There was no door. Frank checked his watch. It was 11:12 PM on Christmas day; the laser had knocked him out for about twenty hours.
There was a humming noise and the black wall slid into the floor revealing a large foyer. It was adorned with the same four colours as the room and had the same smell. Frank stepped out into the foyer cautiously, his hand moving to his guns. Another wall slid down and something moved beyond it. Frank reached for his guns but grabbed only air. He looked down and noticed not only that his guns were missing, but that he was completely naked. He looked back up and saw three individuals (if you could call them that) enter the room. Frank would later find it difficult to put into words how these individuals actually looked, but he would eventually find the most accurate description to be “upright slug aliens.” There was a cyan alien in front, followed by a magenta alien and a yellow alien. They moved slowly on four appendages that were halfway between spider legs and tentacles and had metal devices wrapped around a constantly shifting orifice. They smelled so strongly of the “fast food kitchen oil” that Frank had to actively stop himself from gagging. 
They stopped four meters away from Frank and stood in a line. The orifice of the cyan alien opened and emitted a cross between cicadas buzzing and white noise. Frank started moving his hands to cover his ears but by then the noise had stopped. There was a short pause and then the cyan alien’s metal device began to translate. “HULLO. FANK. ELLINGTON.” The cyan alien’s device said. 
Then the magenta alien started making the cicada/white noise sounds. “WE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT FANK FOR SOME TIME NOW.”
There was a pause and then the yellow alien spoke. “COME WITH US.” The yellow alien waited for the metal device to finish and then exited the foyer. The magenta alien, the cyan alien and Frank followed. They moved into a narrow hallway with the same triadic colour scheme. 
“WE HAVE LOOK FOR POWERFUL PERSONS LIKE FANK FOR LONG LONG TIME. LONG LONG TIME.” Said the cyan alien after a while.
“To do what?” Frank asked. The magenta alien looked back at him. 
“WE KNEW FANK WAS SO POWERFUL AFTER HE CHANGE TIMELINE.”
“That doesn’t answer my que—”
“QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED IN SOFT ROOM.” The aliens turned away from him. They walked for another ten minutes. They came to multiple forks and Frank tried to memorize the turns.
“Left left left right left right le—”
“WE IS HERE.” The aliens stopped so suddenly that Frank almost bumped into the yellow one. The idea made him shiver. (Along with his lack of clothes.) They were standing in front of a wall with hundreds of tiny buttons and switches and a twenty foot tall metal door. Half the door was covered by a long sign with words written on it in dozens of different languages. Most of them were alien to Frank but he recognized French and Vietnamese. English was at the bottom of the sign. In big capital letters, the door was labelled “THE SOFT ROOM”.

**Part Four: Colon
Chapter Four: The Soft Room**
“FANK WILL GO IN SOFT ROOM NOW.” The magenta alien declared.
“Do I have to?” Frank crossed his arms and surveyed the door. There was an awkward silence.
“Hello? Are you guys still th—?”
“FANK HAS TWENTY MORE TIME UNITS TO ENTER SOFT ROOM.” Frank wasn’t sure if it was possible, but he thought the cyan alien’s translation device sounded angry.
Frank chuckled and looked back smugly at the aliens. It might not have been apparent before now, but transforming into an immortal, time-traveling, super-powered, hybrid being gave Frank a bit of an ego. And the fact that he was up against three globs that looked ill equipped to fight anything more than a baby dolphin certainly didn’t help. Also, he was having a pretty bad day.
“YOU THINK I’M SCARED OF YOU? WHAT A JOKE! YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS LOOK LIKE PLAY-DOH LEFT IN THE SUN FOR TOO LONG! YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE IF THE PHRASE “CUT THE CHEESE” HAD A CORPOREAL FORM. I COULD BEAT YOU UP WITH TWO ARMS TIED BEHIND MY BACK AND ONE OF MY LEGS SHOVED UP MY BUTT! YOU KNOW WHO I AM? DO YOU? I’M FRANK WELLINGTON YOU WET TURDS! I’M A TURTLE KANGAROO HYBRID! I ONCE KICKED A GUY SO HARD, HE EXPLODED INTO A THOUSAND TINY PIECES AND OPENED A PORTAL ACROSS SPACE AND TIME? HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE DONE THAT HUH? NONE OF YOU! NONE! THAT’S HOW MANY OF YOU! HOW MANY OF ME HAVE DONE THAT? ONE! ONE! THAT’S INFINITELY MORE THAN YOU. INDEFINITELY MORE THAN YOU! YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT? I DID GRADE TEN MATH YOU MOIST BAGS OF URINE! HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE DONE GRADE TEN MATH? HUH? I DROPPED OUT HALFWAY THROUGH. BUT STILL. IT COUNTS OKAY?” 
Frank said all that in one breath. The hallway was now deadly silent except for the loud rasping sounds Frank made as he tried to catch his breath. Frank had an ego alright. And maybe a slight insecurity about not finishing tenth grade math. But after that day, Frank swore never to give into it again.
The front two appendages of the yellow alien moved up in unison. It must have happened in a thousandth of a second because Frank had no time to react. The yellow alien charged at Frank at a speed he couldn’t have matched even if he wasn’t gasping for air. At the same time, the magenta alien pushed a button on the wall that instantly lowered the Soft Room door. The yellow alien's body made contact with Frank and then bounced off. It wasn’t slimy like he expected, but smooth and moist like a fogged up mirror. Frank flew into the Soft Room and hit the wall at the end of it. Then the cyan alien, moving just as fast as the other two, pushed another button which made the door appear again.
“Wha—”
“WELCOME TO SOFT ROOM. FANK.” The yellow alien said .“IT WILL MAKE FANK SOFT.” 
“Soft… like emotionally? Or…”
“SOFT… LIKE ICE CREAM.”

Chapter Five: Soft Like Ice Cream**
“SOFT… LIKE ICE CREAM.” The magenta alien said.
“Wha- what? What do you mean like ice cream?”
“SOFT LIKE ICE CREAM.” The cyan alien repeated.
“WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIKE ICE CREAM?!” Frank was worried now.
“WE MEAN IT WILL MAKE FANK SOFT. SO FANK IS MORE EASILY DIGESTIBLE. FIRST EAT FANK AND THEN EAT ALL HUMANS.” The yellow alien flipped a switch on the wall and a loud humming began. Frank felt the Soft Room heating up. He looked around and realized what was going on. He was in a giant microwave.
“Oh my god.” Frank thought. “THEY’RE GOING TO HEAT ME UP AND THEN EAT MY MELTED BODY… LIKE ICE CREAM!”
He started pounding wildly on the door and the walls, but it made no impact. LIKE ICE CREAM.” The thought repeated over and over in Frank’s head. He was now panicking. 
“GUY GUYS GUYS. I’M REALLY REALLY SORRY I CALLED YOU PLAY-DOH AND WET TURDS AND MOIST SACKS OF URINE. I’M REALLY REALLY SORRY. REALLY!”
No response. 
“PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY I’M TELLING YOU! MY NAME IS BANK SHELLINGTON FROM SHELLINGTON NEW ZEALAND. OH PLEASE OH GOD NOT LIKE THIS.”
No response.
“YOU GUYS WANT TO EAT POWERFUL THINGS RIGHT? RIGHT? YOU WERE WATCHING ME BECAUSE I WAS POWERFUL? WELL... WELL I KNOW SOMEONE MORE POWERFUL THAN ME. A LOT MORE POWERFUL. THEY COULD PROBABLY BEAT ME UP WITH TWO ARMS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACK AND ONE OF THEIR LEGS SHOVED UP THEIR BUTT!”
The magenta alien pushed a button and the humming stopped. Frank stopped hitting the door and collapsed on the ground. His green skin was now several shades darker, and he was sweating like crazy.
“OH THANK GOD! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.”
The cyan alien pushed another button and a glass window appeared on the door. Frank stood up and looked at the aliens through it.
“FANK. NAME THIS PERSON.”

Chapter Six: Ack Patt**
“FANK. NAME THIS PERSON.” The yellow alien said. Frank thought he heard greed in the robotic voice.
“Who? Oh..” Frank couldn’t think of anyone. 
“FANK. NAME THIS PERSON.” The magenta alien repeated.
“Oh.. Geez...” Frank frantically searched his mind for a name. “Jack Platt!” He blurted out.
The aliens pushed a set of buttons. They must have been spelling out “Jack Platt”, because a second later there was a buzzing sound and a young man with dark hair dropped from the ceiling.
“Huh? Wha…” Jack stood up and noticed the aliens. “AAAAAAHHH!!!” Jack took several steps back, tripped on his shoelaces and fell to the ground. He turned around to grab the wall for support. He noticed Frank through the window. “Y-YOU!” He pointed at Frank through the thick glass. “YOU…,” Jack pointed to the top of his own head, where Frank had shot him. “MY HEAD STILL HURTS AND THERE’S…THERE’S…YOU GAVE ME BRAIN DAMAGE YOU…YOU!” Jack was shaking his fists and his face had turned red. He was somehow so mad that he forgot about the slime aliens behind him.
While Jack Platt screamed obscenities at an exasperated Frank Wellington, the cyan alien turned to his associates. “WE HAS SPOKEN TO THIS ACK PATT BEFORE. TRUE?”
“TRUE. WE SEE HIM IN OTHER TIMELINE. HE WAS OLD MAN THEN.” The yellow alien responded.
“WE WAS THINKING THAT ACK PATT WAS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE ACK PATT DESTROY PLANET BUT TURN OUT TO BE BIG DOOFUS” The magenta alien said. The other two nodded in agreement. “BUT WE SOFTEN BIG DOOFUS ANYWAY! NOT VERY POWERFUL BUT VERY SOFT. YUM YUM!”
Jack and Frank heard most of that. Jack stopped yelling and Frank started panicking again. “NO! THIS VERSION OF JACK PLATT IS DIFFERENT I SWEAR!” Frank waved his arms wildly to get the aliens’ attention. “HE’S VERY POWERFUL! SHOW ’EM JACK!”
“Uh I don’t know about that...” Jack shrugged.
“HE’S BEING MODEST C’MON SHOW ‘EM YOUR HIDDEN TALENTS!”
Jack thought for a moment. “Well I can wiggle my ears!” Jack began wiggling his ears. The aliens looked unimpressed. 
Frank let out a sob and hit his head against the wall. “We’re all gonna die…”
“FANK IS BIG LIAR.” The cyan alien said suddenly and then reached for the button that made the humming start.
“NO! PLEASE GOD NO!” Frank was jumping up and down. “I KNOW SOMEONE ELSE! YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME! I KNOW SOMEONE SO POWERFUL. THEY COULD PROBABLY BEAT ME UP WITH TWO ARMS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACK AND *TWO* LEGS SHOVED UP THEIR BUTT. PLEASE!”
“FANK GET ONE MORE CHANCE.” The cyan alien said.
Frank took a deep breath. This may have been the greatest deep breath in the entire history of the universe, because during it, Frank thought of a brilliant plan. 
“Um… Okay I got it… Louisa Koné?”

**Part Four: Colon
Chapter Seven: Recapitulation**
“Um… Uh… Louisa Koné?” Frank said.
The aliens pushed the buttons again and Louisa’s body fell from the ceiling, and for the second time in one day, it hit the ground with a crunch.
“Oh! She’s sleeping! Someone who’s that powerful needs to sleep a lot y’know? That’s why we humans have something called a power nap right?” Frank looked anxiously at the aliens. He was not a very good liar but he suspected the aliens were not very good at discerning them.
The aliens started aggressively tapping Louisa’s body with their appendages.
“HOW TO WAKE UP LAWEEZA.” The cyan alien asked.
“Only someone really powerful can wake someone really powerful from a power nap!”
“Yeah! That’s like science or something.” Jack agreed. 
“Let me out and I’ll wake her up.” There was a long pause during which the fate of the planet was decided.
The yellow alien opened the Soft Room doors. Frank leapt out, landed next to Louisa’s body and stuck his hand into her lab coat pocket. He put what he needed into his pouch and then scooped up Jack with one hand.
“W-WHAT ARE YOU—LET ME DOWN!” Jack protested as Frank began to run. He sprinted as fast as he could down the hallway but when he looked back he saw the aliens gaining on them. Jack saw the same thing and started screaming.
Frank reached into his pouch with his free hand and took out the device he had taken from Louisa’s lab coat: the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid remote. He moved a hand over the black button and mashed it as hard as he could.
“C’MON C’MON C’MON!” He was pressing it over and over again. His hand slipped and pressed the orange one too. “DAMMIT! C’MON!” Frank was paying so much attention to the button that he didn’t notice that he had come to a dead end. 
BAM! Frank ran into a wall. Jack, still screaming, fell to the ground. Dazed, Frank looked frantically around for somewhere to go but could only see a storage room. He stumbled in, dragging a screeching Jack Platt behind him.
“HA! HUH HAH!” Frank yelled out. The storage room was where all his stuff had been moved when they stripped him. He quickly identified his dual machine guns from a big pile of miscellaneous items from the aliens’ previous exploits. He picked them up and had a second to appreciate how much he had missed them before the aliens burst into the room. 
“AAAAAAAAAAAH!!!” Jack screeched and curled up into a fetal position.
The magenta alien entered first, followed by the cyan alien and finally the yellow alien. They looked very mad.
“FANK LIE! FANK. WILL DIE!!!” The aliens all shouted in unison.
“ALIENS STUPID! ALIENS WILL DIE!!!” Frank shouted back and began firing his machine guns.
“AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” BAM BAM BAM! BING BING BONG BONG! BAM BAM! (That’s what it sounded like.) 
Bullets rained down on the aliens. The force was enough to stop the aliens from advancing, but their skin was so incredibly thick that the bullets bounced off.
BAM BAM BAM! DING DING DING!
The aliens began advancing. Jack finally pulled himself together, grabbed a gun and began helping Frank hold back the aliens.
Two minutes, sixteen reloads, and seven hundred twenty bullets later, Frank and Jack ran out of ammo. Dripping with sweat, Frank threw his guns on the ground and put his fists up in front of him in a boxing stance.
“C’MON!!! I’M NOT DONE YET!!!” Frank screamed at the top of his lungs. “COME AT ME!!! I STILL HAVE TWO GUNS RIGHT OVER HERE!!!” He gestured to his biceps. “FIGHT ME YOU PLAY-DOH! YOU WET TURDS!! YOU MOIST SACKS O—” That’s when he heard it. 
Faintly in the distance there was music playing.
*Cheetah Monorail Hybrid… *
“Heh heh… ha ha…”
*It’s my one ambition… *
“HEHEHEHEHEHE… WOOOOO…”
*Cheetah Monorail Hybrid… *
“HAHAHAHAHAHA… GET BENT!!! YEAH!!!”
*It’s my only mission*
“WOOOOOOO!!!! I’M BANK SHELLI—I MEAN FRANK WELLINGTON MOTHERFU-”
**KABLOOEY**

**Part Four: Colon
Chapter Eight: Kablooey**
In the previous chapter, Frank wrote “KABLOOEY”. Frank stands by this decision. When the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid impacted the Devil’s Coil, it was not a “KABAM” or a “KABLAM” or even a “KABOOM.” It was a “KABLOOEY”.
Although the sound is accurately described as “KABLOOEY”, “KABLOOEY” does not do justice to the magnitude of sound that was made when the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid ripped through the Devil’s Coil, causing the greatest explosion that has ever and will ever be known. It would probably have to be more like “KABLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEY!!!!!”
But that would’ve just been obnoxious.
I don’t know if any of you guys have seen this really old movie called “Star Wars”. But in it, there’s this guy named Luke Skywalker who blows up this giant space station called the Death Star and the explosion is so powerful that there’s nothing left. The audience is expected to believe that the blast just instantly melts all the metal parts, and all that’s left is a bunch of glowing stuff floating into nothingness underscored by Williams’ musical onomatopoeia. Totally unrealistic right? For the Star Wars scene: maybe, but for the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid explosion: that’s exactly what happened.
The Devil’s Coil ran on an element that would be discovered by humanity ten years later and named Wellingtonium (After Frank of course). Wellingtonium is extremely explosive. Imagine something really explosive and then imagine something a thousand times more explosive than that and you’ll probably get about halfway to how explosive Wellingtonium is. The point is that Wellingtonium goes “KABLOOEY”.
So, when the Cheetah Monorail Hybrid, the most powerful thing in the world, crashed into a giant ship fueled with giant tubes of liquid Wellingtonium, it instantly disintegrated everything. The explosion reduced the entire ship to atoms.
Such an explosion also produced an unfathomable amount of light. When the Colon exploded, 23.74% of the earth's population was looking up at the sky. All of those people were permanently blinded. 5.64% of those people also proceeded to have heart attacks and 78.92% of those people died. It was not a good day for humanity.
What about Frank though? What happened to him? Wasn’t he in the Colon when it exploded? How is he writing this right now? Well, Frank doesn’t feel like answering those questions right now. Maybe another day. 

P.S. Many of you might be thinking: “tHEre’s nO sOund iN spACe hOw caN theRE bE mUsiC aNd an eXPLosION? hA hA i’M sO sMart!” Well Louisa Koné probably figured out music in space, and Wellingtonium probably explodes so powerfully that there’s sound in space or something. Who knows?

**Epilogue**
Hello, It is me again: Dr. Rick Nguyen. If you have been paying attention to my story dear reader, then you know that so far I have recounted the events leading up to and including the death of Frank Wellington. If you have been paying *very* close attention then you might also know that this is not the first time Frank Wellington’s life has met an abrupt end (Although it is for *this* version of Frank Wellington).
With that in mind, I would take you to the final setting of my story: Roy Thomson Hall at 9:17 PM on January 1, 2025, the night of the event later to be known as “The Humpty Dumpty Incident of 2025.” The concert hall was completely full for the premiere of “Förbudsmotståndare”, the highly anticipated Swedish operetta loosely based on the events of the film “Shrek 4: Shrek Forever After”.
At exactly 9:17, Mikael Karlsson (the actor that played Humpty Dumpty (Or “Äggformad Äggman” as he is known in the musical)) finished his aria to thunderous applause when the first of the many unfortunate incidents that would happen that night unfolded. A man with dark hair, a woman with round glasses, and a humanoid creature with green skin, and brown fur materialised on stage. They all had pink powder on their noses. The green man was heavily armed.
The audience, thinking this impossible appearance out of thin air to be a clever work of stagecraft, cheered enthusiastically. And Karlsson, believing the green skinned individual to be his co-star Anders Fredriksson (who plays Shrek/Skrëk), turned to the green man and began walking toward him. 
At this point in the story, it is important to understand what was *supposed* to happen at this moment to understand what actually happens next. At that point in the operetta, Äggformad Äggman was supposed to be given Skrëk’s magic wand and use it to break the fourth wall and cast a spell on the audience.
And so Karlsson went to the green man and waited patiently for him to hand over the prop. When that obviously did not happen, Karlsson took matters into his own hands and snatched what he believed to be the wand from the green man’s belt. However, what Karlsson took was not a prop, but was in fact a fully loaded automatic machine gun pistol. The green man—who is Frank Wellington by the way if you *really* haven’t been paying attention—saw Karlsson wave the firearm toward the audience in slow motion, helpless to stop what he knew was going to happen next.
Karlsson’s fingers moved to what he believed was the trigger that shoots confetti into the audience and pulled it confidently. As Karlsson later found out under the dim lights of a police interrogation room, this trigger did not shoot confetti but did in fact shoot 9mm hollow point high penetration rounds.
Karlsson was only able to hold down the trigger for 0.23 seconds before Frank punched him in the face, knocking him unconscious. Those 0.23 seconds were enough for three bullets to be ejected from the barrel of the gun. The first one hit a fire alarm which exploded and started blaring, the second one hit a major ceiling light which exploded leaving half the hall in darkness, and the third one hit an old man in the pinky toe, which also exploded. All things considered, the damage wasn’t too bad. 
In his fourth autobiography, (*Die Like a Turtle, Die Like a Kangaroo* (bizarrely written in second person future tense)) Frank Wellington describes the atmosphere in that moment to be “bonkers”. Everyone was rushing to the exits and yelling. All while the fire alarm was blaring and the lights were flickering. On top of all that, Anders Fredriksson, who had just entered the stage and could not hear nor see the chaos through the elaborate costume that he was wearing, continued on with the scene and started delivering a heartfelt monologue that blared out of all the speakers in the hall. Nobody was killed, but fourteen people were injured.
bingusThat’s pretty much everything there is to know about “The Humpty Dumpty Incident of 2025”. Upon first glance, everything leading up to and including the incident seems stupid and dumb; just one stupid thing followed by another stupid thing. That is because it is true. This entire thing was incredibly dumb and I can’t believe I spent all month writing about it. What a waste of time!
bingusAnyway, I feel like I owe you all some closure. Through all this chaos, Jack, Louisa and Frank were able to quietly slip out the back and return to their “normal” lives. Jack reunited with Ben and they got married a month later. He never dabbled in politics ever again and instead lived happily ever after. Louisa returned all the money, was cleared of all criminal charges, gave up all the mad scientist stuff and started doing actual biomechanical research. She reunited with her mom and little brother and she lived happily ever after. Frank partnered with Louisa to create a serum that would turn him human again. With their combined intellect, they were able to figure it out in two days. Frank turned human again, put his crime fighting days behind him, and decided to start writing about history. That’s right! It’s me! I’m Frank Wellington! I changed my name! Bet you didn’t expect that, did you! Anyway, I lived happily ever after.
THE END
